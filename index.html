<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>
I am currently an <b>Associate Professor</b> (Tenured) in the Department of Computer Science, <a href="https://www.en.aau.dk/">Aalborg University</a>, Denmark. 
I am also a faculty member in the <a href="https://www.daisy.aau.dk/">Center for Data-Intensive Systems (Daisy)</a> with 
<a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/christian-s-jensen"> Prof. Christian S. Jensen</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.aau.dk/~byang/"> Prof. Bin Yang</a>. 
<p>    
Before joining Aalborg University in Aug 2020, I was pursuing my Ph.D. degree at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, 
<a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/">the University of New South Wales</a> Sydney, Australia from Apr 2017 to Apr 2020. 
My supervisors are <a href="/http://linayao.com/">Dr Lina Yao</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/homepageofsenwang/">Dr Sen Wang</a>. 
I was an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) scholarship holder between 2017-2020 (awarded in 2016). </br>
<p>
From Jan 2017 to Apr 2017, I was working as a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">The University of British Columbia, Canada</a>.  
From Jul 2015 to Dec 2016, I was at <a href="http://www.spreadtrum.com/en/index.html">Spreadtrum Communications, Inc, China</a>, 
working as a Digital Integrated Circuit Design Engineer. I received my Master degree from the <a href="http://english.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> 
in 2015, and my Bachelor Degree from <a href="http://www.jlu.edu.cn/">Jilin University</a> in 2012, both major in Microelectronics.</br>
<p>
My current research interest lies in Data And Learning-based Intelligence with Novel applications.
